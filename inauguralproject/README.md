# Inaugural project

In inaguralproject.ipynb you find my submissing to the first project of the course, Introduction to Programming and Nummerical Analysis. Besides codes, the submission contains explanations of the codes and results.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
