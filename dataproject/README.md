# Data analysis project

The project is titled Price elasticity of energy demand in Denmark and is about price elasticity of energy demand for industries in Denmark. A new political reform suggests that large industrial energy consumers are offered a reduction in energy tariffs if they are willing to accept temporary disconnection during the most extreme load times (source: Tarifarbejdet - afrapporting fra Arbejdsgruppen, 2020). Therefore, only the industries will be analyzed

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

The **following datasets** has been applied:

1. Spotprices.csv (*https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/Elspotprices#metadata-info*) 
1. Consumption.csv (*https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/ConsumptionDK3619codehour*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
